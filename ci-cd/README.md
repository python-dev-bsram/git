| **Topic**                      | **Details**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| **Git Branching**              | 1. `git branch branch-name`: Creates a branch but does not switch to it; you’ll need to run `git checkout branch-name` separately. <br> 2. `git checkout -b branch-name`: Creates and switches to the new branch in one step.                                                                               |
| **Staging with Exclusions**    | `git add -- .':!.pycache'`: Stages all files except `.pycache` (useful for avoiding unnecessary files in commits).                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Pushing Branches**           | `git push --set-upstream origin branch-name`: Pushes a new branch to the remote repository and sets up tracking if the branch doesn’t already exist there.                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Pipeline Structure**         | - Pipelines consist of **Jobs** (individual tasks) and **Stages** (groups of jobs executed in a specific order). <br> - Common pipeline types include: **Basic Pipeline**, **DAG Pipeline**, **Parent-Child Pipeline**, and **Multi-Project Pipeline**.                                                    |
| **Purpose of Stages**          | Stages define the job execution sequence in pipelines. This ensures jobs with dependencies run sequentially, while allowing parallel execution for independent jobs, thus optimizing resource use.                                                                                                          |
| **Stage Definition**           | 1. **Default Order**: GitLab by default runs jobs in pre-defined pre and post-stages within each job. <br> 2. **Explicit Definition**: Manually list stages in the pipeline configuration file to control exact job ordering.                                       |
| **Artifacts in CI/CD**         | Artifacts are files or directories produced by jobs in one stage. These are stored and passed to subsequent stages, making it easier to reuse outputs (e.g., build files or test results) across stages.                                                                                                   |
| **Manual Process (No CI/CD)**  | 1. **Branch Creation**: Separate branches are created for specific tasks, which are merged later. <br> 2. **Build & Integration Team**: Manually performs code review and testing. <br> 3. **Operations Team**: Manually deploys code based on instructions, which is prone to human error and delays. <br> 4. **Limitations**: Lacks automation, making it a slower, unstreamlined process. |
| **Benefits of CI/CD Automation** | 1. **Shared Repository**: A central codebase accessible to the entire team. <br> 2. **Frequent Commits**: Team members frequently commit and merge, keeping the codebase current. <br> 3. **Automated Testing**: Build server automatically tests code, reducing manual intervention for Build and Integration Team. <br> 4. **Operational Scripts**: Deployment scripts, often in Unix, automate deployment steps. <br> 5. **End-to-End Pipeline**: CI/CD pipeline automates testing, building, deployment, and release, making the deployment process faster and more reliable. |
